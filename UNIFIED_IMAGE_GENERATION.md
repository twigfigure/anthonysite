# Unified Hunter Image Generation

## The Problem We Solved

**Original Approach:** Generate avatar and splash art as two separate API calls
- ‚ùå Character inconsistency (different face, hair, outfit between images)
- ‚ùå Costs 2 API calls per hunter (~$0.08 per hunter)
- ‚ùå Takes longer (2 sequential generations)

**New Approach:** Generate both views in a single combined image, then split
- ‚úÖ Perfect character consistency (same character in both views)
- ‚úÖ Costs 1 API call per hunter (~$0.04 per hunter)
- ‚úÖ Faster generation (single API call)
- ‚úÖ Guaranteed matching design, colors, outfit, and features

---

## How It Works

### 1. Generate Combined Image

The AI generates a **single wide horizontal image** containing:
- **Left side (40%)**: Portrait/avatar view (neck-up close-up)
- **Right side (60%)**: Full-body splash art (epic action pose)
- **Same character** in both views with identical features

**Prompt enforces:**
- Exact same facial features, hair, armor, and design
- Consistent color palette across both views
- Korean manhwa-inspired art style
- Transparent background

### 2. Split Image

JavaScript splits the combined image into two separate images:
```
Combined Image (1024x1024)
‚îú‚îÄ Left 40% (410x1024) ‚Üí Avatar
‚îî‚îÄ Right 60% (614x1024) ‚Üí Splash Art
```

### 3. Crop & Upload

Each image is cropped to remove whitespace and uploaded separately to Supabase Storage.

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`hunterImagePrompts.ts`**
   - Removed: `generateHunterAvatarPrompt()`
   - Removed: `generateHunterSplashArtPrompt()`
   - Added: `generateHunterCombinedPrompt()` - Creates dual-view character sheet

2. **`imageUtils.ts`**
   - Added: `splitHunterImage()` - Splits combined image at 40/60 split point

3. **`RecruitHunterDialog.tsx`**
   - Changed: Single API call instead of parallel calls
   - Added: Image splitting step before cropping
   - Updated: Toast notifications to reflect new workflow

---

## Generation Flow

```
User clicks "Recruit Hunter"
    ‚Üì
Generate combined prompt
    ‚Üì
Toast: "Generating hunter artwork..."
    ‚Üì
Single Gemini API call (10-15 seconds)
    ‚Üì
Receive combined base64 image
    ‚Üì
Toast: "Processing images..."
    ‚Üì
Split image into avatar (left 40%) and splash art (right 60%)
    ‚Üì
Crop whitespace from both images
    ‚Üì
Toast: "Uploading images..."
    ‚Üì
Upload both to Supabase Storage
    ‚Üì
Create hunter in database with both URLs
    ‚Üì
Toast: "Hunter recruited!"
    ‚Üì
Display in roster with consistent artwork
```

## Prompt Structure

### Combined Prompt Key Features

```
Create a dual-view character sheet for [Name], a [Rank]-rank [Class] hunter.

CRITICAL LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:
- WIDE horizontal image (landscape orientation)
- LEFT SIDE: Portrait/Avatar (40% width)
- RIGHT SIDE: Full-body splash art (60% width)
- SAME CHARACTER with IDENTICAL features on both sides
- Transparent background

LEFT SIDE - PORTRAIT (40%):
- Neck-up close portrait
- 3/4 view angle
- Detailed facial features
- Show armor/headgear

RIGHT SIDE - SPLASH ART (60%):
- Full body epic action pose
- [Class-specific pose]
- Complete equipment visible
- Dynamic angle

CHARACTER DESIGN (IDENTICAL ON BOTH SIDES):
- [Class appearance]
- [Rank theme]
- [Color palette]
- Same face, hair, outfit everywhere
```

---

## Image Splitting Logic

### Split Function (`splitHunterImage`)

```javascript
// Calculate split point (40% for avatar, 60% for splash)
const splitPoint = Math.floor(width * 0.4);

// Extract left 40% (avatar)
avatarCanvas.width = splitPoint;
avatarCanvas.height = height;
avatarCtx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, splitPoint, height, 0, 0, splitPoint, height);

// Extract right 60% (splash art)
splashWidth = width - splitPoint;
splashCanvas.width = splashWidth;
splashCanvas.height = height;
splashCtx.drawImage(img, splitPoint, 0, splashWidth, height, 0, 0, splashWidth, height);
```

**Why 40/60 split?**
- Avatar needs less width (just head and shoulders)
- Splash art needs more width (full body pose)
- Matches typical game character sheet layouts

---

## Benefits

### 1. Character Consistency ‚úÖ

**Before (separate generations):**
- Avatar has blonde hair, blue eyes
- Splash art has brown hair, green eyes
- Different armor designs
- Inconsistent color schemes

**After (unified generation):**
- Identical facial features in both views
- Same hair color and style
- Matching armor and outfit
- Consistent color palette
- Obviously the same character

### 2. Cost Savings üí∞

**Before:**
- 2 API calls per hunter
- Free tier: 25 hunters/day (50 images √∑ 2)
- Paid tier: ~$0.08 per hunter (2 √ó $0.04)

**After:**
- 1 API call per hunter
- Free tier: 50 hunters/day
- Paid tier: ~$0.04 per hunter (1 √ó $0.04)

**50% cost reduction!**

### 3. Speed Improvement ‚ö°

**Before:**
- Generate avatar: 10-15 seconds
- Generate splash art: 10-15 seconds
- Total: 20-30 seconds (sequential)

**After:**
- Generate combined: 10-15 seconds
- Split images: <1 second (client-side)
- Total: 10-16 seconds

**Nearly 2x faster!**

### 4. Better User Experience üé®

- More cohesive character roster
- Professional game-quality consistency
- Faster recruitment process
- Better first impression of characters

## Testing

### Test the New System

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/guild-manager`
2. Click **"Recruit"** button
3. Fill in hunter details:
   - Name: Test Character
   - Rank: Try different ranks (B, S, SSS)
   - Class: Try different classes (Mage, Fighter, etc.)
4. Click **"Recruit Hunter"**
5. Watch the toast notifications:
   - "Generating hunter artwork..."
   - "Processing images..."
   - "Uploading images..."
   - "Hunter recruited!"
6. Check the roster - you should see the avatar
7. Click the hunter - you should see the splash art
8. **Verify consistency**: Avatar and splash art should clearly be the same character

### What to Look For

‚úÖ **Character features match:**
- Same face shape and features
- Same hair color and style
- Same armor/outfit design
- Same color scheme

‚úÖ **Quality:**
- Clean transparent backgrounds
- Sharp details
- Professional illustration quality
- Properly cropped (no excess whitespace)

‚úÖ **Performance:**
- Total time: 10-20 seconds
- Single API call (check browser Network tab)
- Both images uploaded to Storage

---

## Edge Cases & Handling

### If Split Fails

The system will fall back gracefully:
```javascript
catch (error: any) {
  toast({
    title: 'Failed to recruit hunter',
    description: error.message,
    variant: 'destructive',
  });
}
```

User sees error, can retry recruitment.

### If AI Generates Different Characters

**Unlikely** because the prompt explicitly requires:
- "EXACT SAME CHARACTER"
- "IDENTICAL features"
- "MUST be consistent"
- Detailed character design specs repeated

But if it happens:
- Delete the hunter
- Recruit again (different AI generation each time)

### If Image Dimensions Vary

The split function handles any dimensions:
```javascript
const splitPoint = Math.floor(width * 0.4); // Works for any width
```

Always splits at 40/60 ratio regardless of actual pixel size.

## Prompt Engineering Notes

### Key Phrases for Consistency

The prompt uses these to enforce consistency:
- "SAME character" (appears 3 times)
- "IDENTICAL features" (appears 2 times)
- "MUST be consistent"
- "CHARACTER DESIGN (MUST BE IDENTICAL ON BOTH SIDES)"
- Repeats color palette, appearance, theme for both sides

### Layout Instructions

Critical for proper splitting:
- "WIDE horizontal image (landscape orientation)"
- "LEFT SIDE: Portrait (40% of image width)"
- "RIGHT SIDE: Splash art (60% of image width)"
- "Clear vertical separation"

### Transparent Background

Enforced multiple times:
- "Transparent background (PNG format) is ESSENTIAL"
- "Transparent background is MANDATORY"
- "No background elements, only the character"

This ensures clean display over gradients in the UI.

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements

1. **Adjustable Split Ratio**
   - Allow user to choose split point (30/70, 50/50, etc.)
   - Store preference in guild settings

2. **Combined Image Preview**
   - Show the full combined image before splitting
   - Allow user to regenerate if not satisfied

3. **Manual Split Adjustment**
   - Let user drag the split line if AI didn't follow 40/60
   - Save custom split points

4. **Triple View**
   - Add side view or back view (33/33/33 split)
   - More comprehensive character sheet

5. **Batch Generation**
   - Generate multiple hunters at once
   - Process combined images in background
