# World Building: Kingdoms, Regions & Portal System Design

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Purpose:** Establish comprehensive world-building framework for the Guild Manager game, including kingdoms, regions, geographic locations, leadership hierarchy, and named portal system.

---

## Design Overview

This design expands the Guild Manager game world from generic portal names to a rich, lore-driven universe with six distinct kingdoms, each containing 3 regions with specific geographic locations. Portals are named after actual places within these regions, with normal portals using geographic naming and boss portals using historical/lore-based naming.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Hierarchical Geographic System:** Kingdom → Regions → Locations → Portals
2. **Dynamic Portal Spawning:** All regions accessible from start, but portals scale with guild World Level
3. **Cultural Distinction:** Each kingdom has unique government, culture, and aesthetic identity
4. **Lore-Driven Bosses:** Boss and Major Boss portals tied to historical catastrophes and legends
5. **Named Leadership:** Every kingdom and region has a named ruler with personality and motivations

---

## Implementation Considerations

### Database Schema Changes

**New Tables Needed:**
1. **kingdoms** - Store kingdom data (name, government type, capital, culture description)
2. **regions** - Store region data (name, kingdom_id, description, leader info)
3. **locations** - Store specific locations within regions for portal naming
4. **portal_templates** - Update to include region_id and location_id references

**Updated Fields:**
- `portal_templates.name` - Should be generated from location/region or be lore-based for bosses
- `portal_templates.description` - Include lore and geographic context
- `guilds.region` - Should reference the regions table
- `hunters.region` - Should reference the regions table

### Portal Generation Logic

**World Level Scaling:**
- Each region should have portal templates for multiple world levels
- As guild's world_level increases, new portals spawn in existing regions
- Portal difficulty progression: Blue (WL 1-2), Green (WL 2-3), Yellow (WL 3-4), Orange (WL 4-5), Red (WL 5-6), Purple (WL 6-8), Black (WL 8-10)

**Boss Portal Unlocking:**
- Boss portals unlock at specific world levels (6-8 for regular bosses, 8-10 for major bosses)
- One boss portal per kingdom, tied to historical events
- Major boss portals represent existential threats to the entire world

### Guild Expansion System

**Regional Access:**
- All regions in starting kingdom immediately accessible
- Other kingdoms require "expansion" mechanic (influence points, gold cost, quest completion)
- Creates natural progression: Master home kingdom → Expand to others

**Influence & Diplomacy:**
- Guild's relationship with each kingdom could affect portal rewards
- Kingdom-specific quests and reputation systems
- Potential conflict: Expanding to rival kingdoms

## Future Expansion Ideas

### Cross-Kingdom Events
- World bosses that threaten multiple kingdoms
- Kingdom wars that affect portal availability
- Seasonal events tied to kingdom festivals

### Hunter Origins
- Hunters' region/kingdom affects their starting stats and cultural flavor
- Recruitment system could favor hunters from guild's active regions
- Hunter backstories generated based on kingdom lore

### Political Intrigue
- Kingdom leaders could offer special quests
- Regional leaders might have conflicts requiring player choices
- Dynamic world where leadership can change based on events

### Lore Integration
- Hunter activity logs reference specific locations
- Equipment drops named after kingdom cultures
- Skill books tied to regional fighting styles

## Named Character Stats

For complete stats, ranks, affinities, and innate abilities of all named leaders, see:
**[Named Character Stats & Abilities](./2025-10-31-world-building-leaders-stats.md)**

This includes:
- Ranks (SSS, SS, S, A, B) appropriate to their station
- Elemental affinities matching their kingdom/region
- Unique innate abilities (3-5 per character) reflecting their power and role
- 40+ named characters total across all kingdoms

---

## Summary

This design establishes a rich, coherent world with:
- **6 distinct kingdoms**, each with unique government, culture, and history
- **18 total regions** (3 per kingdom) with named leaders and geographic identity
- **126+ named locations** for portal spawning
- **12 boss portals** with deep historical lore
- **Dynamic portal system** that scales with guild world level while keeping all regions accessible

The framework supports both systematic content generation (normal portals) and hand-crafted narrative experiences (boss portals), creating a world that feels alive and worth exploring.

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ **Region Names Updated** - `src/features/guild-manager/lib/gameHelpers.ts` now contains all 18 regions from the six kingdoms
- ✅ **Kingdom Palettes** - `src/features/guild-manager/lib/hunterImagePrompts.ts` already has correct kingdom color palettes and themes
- ✅ **Diverse Name Generation** - Hunter names now include diverse cultural influences (Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy, Romance of Three Kingdoms, Arabic, African, South Asian, Mesoamerican)

### Pending Implementation
- ⏳ **Database Schema** - Need to create kingdoms, regions, and locations tables
- ⏳ **Portal Templates** - Update to reference regions and locations
- ⏳ **Guild/Hunter Region References** - Connect to regions table instead of free text
- ⏳ **Boss Portal Lore** - Implement historical boss portals with lore descriptions
